# Support and Help

Need help getting started or using a project? Here's how.

## How to get help

Please seek support in the following ways:

1. :book: **Read the documentation and other guides** for the project to see if you can figure it out on your own. These are located in the project wiki or in the root `docs/` directory.

1. :bulb: **Search for answers and ask questions on the discussions page.** This is the most appropriate place for debugging issues specific to your use of the project, or figuring out how to use the project in a specific way.

1. :memo: As a **last resort**, you may open an issue to ask for help. However, please clearly explain what you are trying to do, and list what you have already attempted to solve the problem. Provide code samples, but **do not** attach your entire project for someone else to debug. Review our [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## What NOT to do

Please **do not** do any the following:

1. :x: Do not reach out to the author or contributor on social media.

1. :x: Do not email the author or contributor.

1. :x: Do not open duplicate issues or litter an existing issue with +1's.

These are not appropriate avenues for seeking help or support with an open-source project. Please follow the guidelines in the previous section. Public questions get public answers, which benefits everyone in the community. ✌️
