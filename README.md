# Werewolf

This is yet another implementation of the popular game werewolves of millers hill which can be
played online with your friends together. This is pretty similar to Mafia or Among Us. In this game
you have two parties in a small village: the normal villager and some werewolves. The goal of the
game is that the werewolves eliminate all normal villager and the goal for the villager is to
survive this. This game has multiple rounds and different phases with special actions.

The game is a lot of fun for me and my friends. So much fun that I decided to release it as a web
application so that we can play anytime, even if we can't physically meet. That was especially the
case at the time of Corona.

The project is a big construction site and I have ideas all over the place about how to expand on
that so that I can achieve my goal of including all the characters and features from the official
game, including expansions. From there, things can still change here in the future.

If you want to try this game you can check out here:
[werewolf.2complex.de](https://werewolf.2complex.de/).

If you want to help me providing translations, images or the code base you can create an issue. I am
happy to include your submissions. I'll put some more guidance in the wiki that can help you with
this.

If you want to host your own server, please contact me first. I want to have all instances to run
the latest version of the game all the time and for this we need some preparation (e.g. Github
webhooks, keys). Also for this some services needs to be prepared and the documentation is missing
yet (mostly because this is still in work).

## Developer related stuff

Just look into the project wiki. It contains all important information like how
to set this up. The directory `/docs/wiki` also points to the wiki and it was
done to make it easier to edit the wiki and have it in sync with the project.

## License

I didn't found a premade license that fit my requirements the best:

1. You are allowed to clone, fork and modify this project for yourself.
2. You are not allowed to redistribute this project under a different name and/or license.
3. You always have to include a reference to the original project. The current UI does this.
4. There is no commercial use.
5. You have to contribute your modifications or changes back to the original
   project. This doesn't mean they have to be pushed on the main branch but I
   want to have at least an issue, pull request or discussion for this. This
   doesn't include local configurations or secrets.
6. If you run your own server, you have to ensure that you are always running
   the latest version and is in sync to this project.

If you want a special license for you, you can always ask me. Maybe we can come
to an agreement.
